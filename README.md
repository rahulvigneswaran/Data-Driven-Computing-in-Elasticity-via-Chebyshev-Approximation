## Abstract :
This paper proposes a data-driven approach for computing elasticity by means of a non-parametric regression approach rather than an optimization approach. The Chebyshev approximation is utilized for tackling the material data-sets non-linearity of the elasticity. Also, additional efforts have been taken to compare the results with several other state-of-the-art methodologies.
